We went from 50+ banks allowed to invest directly in startups to 4-8 funds hijacking $400m of funding and its 75% guarantees for themselves. Instead of investing in startups, banks are now investing in funds with 75% money-back guarantee if the fund fails.

Any investment from these funds into startups is now exposed to 100% risk which means the situation has not changed. Funds by nature reduce risk by diversifying their investments. Instead, the guarantee should be shifted from the Bank to the Fund level or investor level.

Moreover, these funds are all positioned on different funding stages (seed, growth ...) meaning entrepreneurs have 1-2 funds to negotiate with instead of an original 50 potential sources. This means there is no competition amongst investors and they can bully their way into capital with a \"take it or die\" approach.

On the other hand, funds are much better equipped to understand startups and their markets and can provide greater value than Banks who fail to even provide Kafalat Guaranteed loans without requesting another 100% guarantee. We just need more funds for any given funding stage to create more competition and fairer valuations.

331 should be extended beyond banks to any investor or any startup founder that is willing to move its operations to Lebanon. Banks do not need or deserve guarantees as they bring no additional value to the table and have more money than they know what to do with.

In fact, from an ethical perspective, Banks should not be allowed to invest in companies at all as this sets the ground for unfair competition.

On another note, limiting 331 to local SALs is also scandalous as any startup relies on a regional or global market for growth and the legal structure of SALs is prohibitive. We need to allow investments into offshore companies that provide a more versatile legal framework for borderless businesses. There is simply no advantage for regional business to be based in Lebanon as an SAL with 331 funding. If they can get the funding in Lebanon, they can get it anywhere else !","2016-05-24 18:06:35","2016-10-24"
