"","opinion"
"1","for now we haven't met them in dahr el ein, we will meet them in tripoly soon"
"2","Mr. Riad Salemeh and the release of Circular 331 made the game true in the Lebanese echo system, thank you"
"3","There is a gap in human capital in the tech sector that needs to be addressed via training and education"
"4","The VCs need to invest more in start ups and take more risks, rather than invest in safe start ups .. they are very risk averse."
"5","i believe that most of the money is spent on managerial fees rather than supporting the start-ups themselves."
"6","Yes I do, the ecosystem idea for me now 6 years after i launched my company is an advertising tool to raise more money; we are at the very beginning of building a real ecosystem."
"7","Ecosystem finally growing in Beirut. Circular 331 took a long time to kick in but finally can see change/ results. Primarily banks/ bank partners (VC affiliate firms) understanding gist 331. I am optimistic."
"8","1- Provide equal opportunity to become part of building the ecosystem. Many are parachuted on top just because they knew the right people and are now a burden on the ecosystem. Need weed out the leeches on the system who are becoming the majority. All talk, no real content. Needs to look for existing talents who can add value to the ecosystem. Avoid building with the same people who are doing it solely because they know influential people who put them in a certain place in the ecosystem.
2- Needs to focus on non-tech as well as tech to include other segments of the population."
"9","Regarding the Circular, I believe it is a positive contribution to fostering the growth of the tech sector in Lebanon. On the other hand, the risk is to fund startups without valid business prospects, especially if the incentives of the different parties are not aligned properly."
"10","I think it should be injected in Research and developmemt and universities instead of giving it to VCs"
"11","very blurry definition of scope of companies (sector not well defined, legal entity of company) can money be used to grow beyond lebanon"
"12","To extend beyond the Capital"
"13","Awareness among young population needs to increase.
Specifically targeting high school and University students."
"14","1- most innovative ideas must be supported at all levels, evaluate the situation of each, then take a decision before wasting Startup time, and Public Money 
 2-A steering committee must exist from Financiers/Innovators/Investors/Scientists/Businesses/NGOs/etc... to evaluate all money invested in several startups, ask managed money or VCs why in this and not in that startup? for example why in A Restaurant? or Why in a specific telecom company that is keep losing money? where several examples exist..
3- some regions are not well boosted!? is it a politics or demographics strategy?
4- some domains are not well covered, whom is responsible? Startups, Governments, Central Bank, or World Bank?
5- to save the globe & humanity...many things need to be well planned"
"15","Should further take into account the impracticality of centering the financial / legal activities of Lebanese startups in Lebanon. Lebanese IT startups targeting global markets may very well have only their R&D in Lebanon whilst having their legal / financial HQs established abroad for lack of local e-payment capabilities..."
"16","Regarding my start up , i was the one behind it , without funds nor active cofounders.
As for the circular 331 , in my opinion the availability of funds  is not the only element needed to create the lebanese tech ecosystem.
A large majority of the lebanese youth ( pillars of any tech ecosystem) are not aware of the opportunities that technological advancement can provide.
Thank you for your interest and would you require further much detailed information, you just send me an email.
Best,
Rania"
"17","Not smart money because investors still have outdated mentality and no experience with start-up phase"
"18","It would have been much better if criteria and procedure for application and other matters were more clear and transparent. Currently, it is \who you know\ that allows a startup to benefit from the circular."
"19","Please note that we are designers specialised in creative strategies and project prototyping using our own fab lab. Circular 331 is nay focused on high tech and technological oriented projects. I think there should be more room for designers such as ourselves."
"20","No, Thanks."
"21","-"
"22","I wish it wasn't centralized in limited number of VCs and banks that are all in one bundle and interconnected. some competition between the VCs and the programs would push them to provide better services."
"23","While 331 in spirit is crucial to our ecosystem, its implementation and execution is scandalous.

We went from 50+ banks allowed to invest directly in startups to 4-8 funds hijacking $400m of funding and its 75% guarantees for themselves. Instead of investing in startups, banks are now investing in funds with 75% money-back guarantee if the fund fails.

Any investment from these funds into startups is now exposed to 100% risk which means the situation has not changed. Funds by nature reduce risk by diversifying their investments. Instead, the guarantee should be shifted from the Bank to the Fund level or investor level.

Moreover, these funds are all positioned on different funding stages (seed, growth ...) meaning entrepreneurs have 1-2 funds to negotiate with instead of an original 50 potential sources. This means there is no competition amongst investors and they can bully their way into capital with a \take it or die\ approach.

On the other hand, funds are much better equipped to understand startups and their markets and can provide greater value than Banks who fail to even provide Kafalat Guaranteed loans without requesting another 100% guarantee. We just need more funds for any given funding stage to create more competition and fairer valuations.

331 should be extended beyond banks to any investor or any startup founder that is willing to move its operations to Lebanon. Banks do not need or deserve guarantees as they bring no additional value to the table and have more money than they know what to do with.

In fact, from an ethical perspective, Banks should not be allowed to invest in companies at all as this sets the ground for unfair competition.

On another note, limiting 331 to local SALs is also scandalous as any startup relies on a regional or global market for growth and the legal structure of SALs is prohibitive. We need to allow investments into offshore companies that provide a more versatile legal framework for borderless businesses. There is simply no advantage for regional business to be based in Lebanon as an SAL with 331 funding. If they can get the funding in Lebanon, they can get it anywhere else !"
"24","The process to get proper funding based on this circular 331 is not well defined and it takes more than 12 month to get this type of funding. It needs to be improved in order to get the investment needed for development"
"25","Thanks for giving me the opportunity to be member of this survey, i am actually not an entrepreneur, just maybe minipreneur. I have been awarded a grant just yesterday to start my project, and here i go......Sorry couldn't answer most of the questions.... But i hope i can travel and win the award to get more knowledge and expertise on how build my business in a faster and more efficient way."
"26","BDL and C331 have been amazing supports, and have helped the ecosystem substantially, but much more is needed. The ecosystem is growing ... in an interim state of development. I am confident and optimistic that it will keep improving at a good rate."
"27","I think I was sent this email by mistake. I haven't received any Circular 331, I'm trying to open my own business but I am not done yet. I only applied for a grant, nothing more till now. I changed my business strategy and improving my feasibility study. This survey is not for me."
"28","All looks with no content."
"29","Can't find tech employees anymore, they are all entrepreneurs funded by 331"
"30","We need to diversify those giving out the money and to whom they are giving the money. We need more independent folks investing in more early stage women startups especially as the majority of the money is in connected clicks or VCs or banks that don't invest in anything disruptive or \competitive\ to their portfolio or friends wanting to keep the status quo. And we need more transparency and also confidentiality."
